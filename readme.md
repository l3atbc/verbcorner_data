##Notes

A major database crash early in the project caused some fragmentation in the database tables. The current "working" table was restored from a backup. At a later date, we were able to recover some of the corrupted tables, which had additional data recorded after the backup but before the crash. One file for each table is in the folder Downloads. The latter files all start with "b_a". The script "CombineFiles" combines the two files and saves the output in the root folder. Most users can ignore this information and simply use the files in the root directory.
